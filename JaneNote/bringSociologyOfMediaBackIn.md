# Abstracts

Previous works:

In political communication research, news media tend to be **studied more as a dependent
than independent variable.**

few studies link **structural characteristics of media systems** to the production of journalistic discourse about politics.

In between such micro- and macro- influences, the mezzo-level “journalistic field” represents an important shaping factor heretofore largely ignored.(中观的媒体领域因素经常被忽略）

Future works:

Since variation at the system level is most clearly seen via cross-national comparative studies, international research is best positioned to build more generalizable **theory about the production of journalistically mediated political discourse**. (国际比较研究更能看到系统层面上的变化，可以以此研究新闻媒介政治话语生产的理论）

# Intro

previous: media frame analysis has become a veritable sociological industry

challenge: bring the same sophisticated analysis to bear on understanding media as an independent variable, as part of the process of political meaning making rather than just a convenient indicator of the outcome.(将媒体理解为一个自变量，作为政治意义制定过程的一部分，而不仅仅是结果的便捷指标)

- media-specific actors
- new routines
- role perceptions

RQ:

why some media outlets are more sensationalistic than others?

how “new institutionalist” and “field” theories also make contribution?

Arguments: 

conclude with a discussion of how systematic cross-national research has and can continue to build more generalizable theory about media/politics relations.

## Media and political communication: General Models

- What does this mean for Castells?

He cites the usual litany of ills tied to the news media: **news as entertainment, lack of context, simplification, personalization.**

While Castells’s concept of “media space” cannot help explain why some political debates are more or less simplified, personalized, dramatized, or contextualized than others.

- political debate in a commercialized public sphere

Habermas’s conceptualization of the mass media’s relation to the public sphere largely revolves around the single variable of **commercialization. (the public sphere was thus transformed from a forum for rational-critical debate into a “platform for advertising”)**

- cultural resonance

In this model, “media practices” are generally identified as
one of three major factors, along with culturally available symbols and themes (“cultural
resonances”) and strategic political communication (“sponsor activities”) in shaping public
(media) discourse about social problems.

summary:

1. The single most significant difference between the two systems, they argue, is the greater openness of U.S. journalists to sources other than state and party actors (p. 82), a claim they provide no evidence for other than the content of the news itself, thus engaging in entirely circular reasoning and conflating media as both an independent and dependent variable.
2. One problem with this “social problems” model is its **inadequate conceptualization,** visualization if you will, of the media. Portraying the media as simply “a site on which various social groups —— struggle over the **definition and construction of social reality**”

*note: If media are to be incorporated into studies of political communication, they ought to be just as fully realized, theoretically and empirically, as the other social actors and institutional fields presumed to be important. 

(For example:two very different abortion discourses generated in these two countries are best explained by the deliberate efforts of social actors to shape them)

## Sociology of News: Recategorization of key influences

What are the major factors that shape news coverage of politics?

Schudson (2000) suggests three main influences on news production: **political economy of the society, the social organization of newswork, and (political) culture.**

- **political economy of the society**
- **the social organization of newswork:**

“official dominate the news”,due to the centrality of repoter-source relations.

(social organization of newswork is the outcome of the news media’s relationship, as a
relatively homogeneous institution, to political and economic power.)

sum:organizational dynamics are important ! They probably exert their most powerful semi-autonomous effects not at the level of individual organizations, but at **the mezzo level of the “institution” or interorganizational “field.” (I**t it is “harder to be confident about the reasons why different media take the positions they do”—— relevant factors: owners, advertisers, and audience)

- **(political) culture.**

SUMMARY:

suggesting a basic recategorization of the “major factors” shaping news coverage of politics. These factors are **(a) commercial or economic, (b) political, and (c) the interorganizational field of journalism.** 

historical and cultural analysis would necessarily precede and accompany examination of these three broad structural variables, helping to explain the origin and solidity (or lack thereof) of the journalistic field’s relation to political and economic power.
