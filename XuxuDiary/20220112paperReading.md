### Personal comments:

1. research questions are Simple and easy to understand

2. motivations cite the news coverage, and are fairly strong

3. written format is quite formal and can be regarded as a template !!

4. research methods are also Simple and easy to understand

5. learn from academic template

# Paper Note:

## Introduction:

**1.what they did?**

coverage of specific content was analyzed through the lens of the **Health Belief Mode**l ([Rosenstock, 1974](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2011.610258?src=#)) and in terms of two content themes (i.e., **conspiracy theory and civil liberties).**

The **relations** among these aspects of the videos were assessed as well.

**2.what they find?**

We found that most of these videos were news clips or consumer-generated content. 

The majority of the videos were negative in tone, disapproving of the HPV vaccine. In addition, negative videos were liked more by the viewers than positive or ambiguous ones. 

Accusations of conspiracy theory and infringement of civil liberties were manifested in these videos. 

The videos also presented mixed information related to the key determinants of health behavior as stipulated in the **Health Belief Model.**


**RQ：**

RQ1: What are the sources of YouTube videos about the HPV vaccine (i.e., individuals or organizations that produced the videos)?

RQ2: What are the tones of YouTube videos about the HPV vaccine or to what extent do the videos approve or disapprove the HPV vaccine?

RQ3: Is there a relation between the type of source and viewer responses including number of views, number of likes, and number of dislikes?

RQ4: Is there a relation between the tone of the video and viewer responses including number of views, number of likes, and number of dislikes?

RQ5: Is there a relation between the type of source and the tone of the video?

according to HBM:

RQ6: To what extent do YouTube videos about the HPV vaccine convey information related to vaccine benefits, barriers, susceptibility to HPV, severity of HPV, and self-efficacy, the five HBM factors?

RQ7: Is there a relation between the type of source and mention of each of the five HBM factors?

Two issues:

RQ6: To what extent do YouTube videos about the HPV vaccine convey information related to vaccine benefits, barriers, susceptibility to HPV, severity of HPV, and self-efficacy, the five HBM factors?

RQ7: Is there a relation between the type of source and mention of each of the five HBM factors?

***Health Belief Model (HBM)**

1.perceived susceptibility, deals with how an individual believes that he/she is susceptible to the particular health problem.

2.perceived severity, deals with the individual's belief that not acting on preventing the health problem leads to severe consequences.

3.perceived benefits, posits that the individual must believe that engaging in the preventive behavior will reduce the threat or provide other positive consequences.

4.perceived barriers, deals with the notion that individuals are less likely to adopt the desired preventive behavior if the costs are too great to them

5.In addition to these factors, perceived self-efficacy has been considered as an important determinant of motivation to adopt a recommended health behavior.

**Method**

1. sample  N=172

search by key words, and Following the procedures used in previous studies ([Ache & Wallace, 2008](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2011.610258?src=#); [Keelan et al., 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2011.610258?src=#)), we retained the first 50 videos for each search term and removed duplications across search terms from the sample.

removed duplications

dealing with special conditions:Seven videos were not included in the analysis, as four of them were presented in a language other than English and the other three were no longer accessible on the YouTube site when it came time for coding. 

2. coding schema
   
- Youtube video characteristics, including:title, date of posting, video length, number of videos posted by the user, number of subscribers, whether it was an original or repost, number of views, number of likes, number of dislikes, and the description excerpt.
- other characteristic:the type of source and the tone of the message
- HBM factors including :

(a) benefits, specifically effectiveness of the vaccine (high effectiveness, low effectiveness, or no information); 

(b) barriers, including physical health risks (high risk, low risk, or no information) and psychological risks, meaning the person who received the vaccine suffered from mental or emotional trauma due to the vaccine (present or absent); 

(c) susceptibility, that is, likelihood of contracting the HPV virus (high susceptibility, low susceptibility, or no information); 

(d) severity, namely, whether HPV is linked to cervical cancer (yes or no); 

(e) self-efficacy, defined as steps one could take to obtain the vaccine (present or absent).

3. coding procedure

Intercoder reliability was assessed with Krippendorff's alpha, which was on average .72, an acceptable degree of reliability ([Hayes & Krippendorff, 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2011.610258?src=#)).

4. data  analysis

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests
