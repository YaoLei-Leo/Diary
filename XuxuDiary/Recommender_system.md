### 1.Recommender system intro.

**what is recommendation?**

the shop owners make recommendations of something that I may like:based on my profile; based on the availability of similar items; the recommendation can be different fromtime to time.

**what is recommender system?**
Formal definition:

A recommender system calculates and provides relevant content to the user based on knowledge of the user, content, and interactions between the user and the item.

**what RS refers to in techniques?**

- collaborative filtering 

- content based filtering 
  
- knowledge bases

**Is it better to have a super-good algorithm or to have more data?**

Both have flipsides:
- Super algorithms require super hardware
- More data creates other challenges, like how to access it fast enough
  
We have to find a balance between the two; it won't be a single answer.

Why using Recommender system?
- value for the customer
- value for the provider (it will count bigger)

  *provider made RS to achieve their goals*

**RS purpose and success criteria**

(different perspective, No holistic evaluation scenario exists ) 
- Retrieval perspective
  - "correct"
- Recommendation perspective
  - Serendipity: user don't know it,but still like it 
- Prediction perspective 
- Interaction perspective
  - convince users--explain
- Conversion perspective 
  - change visitor to customer

### 3.taxonomy

*Which recommender system to use in a new application? How to analyse the needs?*

Use the **requirements framework**
Describe using 8 different dimensions:
- Domain
- Purpose
- Context
- Personalization level
- Whose opinions
- Privacy and trustworthiness
- Interfaces
- Algorithms
